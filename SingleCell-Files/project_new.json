Here, we introduce cell hashing, where oligo-tagged antibodies against ubiquitously expressed surface proteins are used to uniquely label cells from distinct samples, which can be subsequently pooled. By sequencing these tags alongside the cellular transcriptome, we can assign each cell to its sample of origin, and robustly identify doublets originating from multiple samples. We demonstrate our approach by pooling eight human PBMC samples on a single run of the 10x Chromium system, substantially reducing our per-cell costs for library generation. Cell hashing is inspired by, and complementary to, elegant multiplexing strategies based on genetic variation, which we also leverage to validate our results. We therefore envision that our approach will help to generalize the benefits of single cell multiplexing to diverse samples and experimental designs.","contributors":[{"institution":"University of California Santa Cruz","contactName":"William,G,Sullivan","projectRole":"data curator","laboratory":"Human Cell Atlas Data Coordination Platform","correspondingContributor":false,"email":"wisulliv@ucsc.edu"},{"institution":"New York Genome Center","contactName":"Peter,,Smibert","projectRole":"co-investigator","laboratory":"Technology Development and Innovation","correspondingContributor":true,"email":"psmibert@nygenome.org"},{"institution":"New York Genome Center","contactName":"Marlon,,Stoeckius","projectRole":"experimental scientist","laboratory":"Technology Development and Innovation","correspondingContributor":false,"email":"mstoeckius@nygenome.org"},{"institution":"New York Genome Center","contactName":"Shiwei,,Zheng","projectRole":"experimental scientist","laboratory":"Satija Lab","correspondingContributor":false,"email":"szheng@nygenome.org"},{"institution":"New York Genome Center","contactName":"Rahul,,Satija","projectRole":"principal investigator","laboratory":"Satija Lab","correspondingContributor":true,"email":"rsatija@nygenome.org"}],"publications":[{"publicationTitle":"Cell Hashing with barcoded antibodies enables multiplexing and doublet detection for single cell genomics","publicationUrl":"https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1603-1"}],"arrayExpressAccessions":[null],"geoSeriesAccessions":[null],"insdcProjectAccessions":[null],"insdcStudyAccessions":[null],"supplementaryLinks":[null]}],"samples":[{"sampleEntityType":["specimens"],"effectiveOrgan":["blood"],"disease":[null],"organ":["blood"],"source":["specimen_from_organism"],"id":["Specimen_PBMC1","Specimen_PBMC2","Specimen_PBMC3","Specimen_PBMC4","Specimen_PBMC5","Specimen_PBMC6","Specimen_PBMC7","Specimen_PBMC8"],"organPart":[null],"preservationMethod":[null]}],"specimens":[{"id":["Specimen_PBMC1","Specimen_PBMC2","Specimen_PBMC3","Specimen_PBMC4","Specimen_PBMC5","Specimen_PBMC6","Specimen_PBMC7","Specimen_PBMC8"],"organ":["blood"],"organPart":[null],"disease":[null],"preservationMethod":[null],"source":["specimen_from_organism"]}],"cellLines":[],"donorOrganisms":[{"id":["Donor_PBMC1","Donor_PBMC2","Donor_PBMC3","Donor_PBMC4","Donor_PBMC5","Donor_PBMC6","Donor_PBMC7","Donor_PBMC8"],"donorCount":8,"genusSpecies":["Homo sapiens"],"organismAge":[null],"organismAgeUnit":[null],"organismAgeRange":null,"biologicalSex":["unknown"],"disease":["normal"]}],"organoids":[],"cellSuspensions":[{"organ":["blood"],"organPart":[null],"selectedCellType":["peripheral blood mononuclear cell"],"totalCells":20000}],"fileTypeSummaries":[{"fileType":"fastq.gz","count":6,"totalSize":83729759795}]}
